# 8KResearch
I love investing and finance, so I wanted to purse a computer science project focusing on finance. As a result, in this project, I am analyzing the quality of financial agreements that are listed in companyâ€™s 8K filings 
and then discovering trends that can used for stock prediction using Yahoo Finance and ThinkOrSwim. I am webscraping specific sections of 8K filings using python scripts, preprocessing the text, and then using tf-idf 
to make predictions on the quality of the finance agreement. I am still working on this project, and the current goal is to anlyzing previous agreements and seeing if I can find a trend with stock prices.
