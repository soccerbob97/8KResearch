Piedmont OP may prepay the loan in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty. Piedmont OP paid customary fees to the lenders in connection with the closing of the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan.The terms of the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan are set forth in the Term Loan Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1. As defined in the Term Loan Agreement, the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan has the option to bear interest at varying levels based on Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR for an interest period selected by Piedmont OP of one or three months, or a Base Rate (which is defined as the greatest of (i) Bank of America’s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (iii) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.0%, and (iv) 1.0%), in each case plus a stated interest rate spread. The stated interest rate spread for borrowings accruing interest based on Daily Simple SOFR and Term SOFR can vary from 0.85% to 1.70%, and the stated interest rate spread for borrowings accruing interest based on the Base Rate can vary from 0.00% to 0.70%, in each case based on the current credit rating of the Registrant or Piedmont OP, whichever is higher. As of the closing of the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan, the applicable interest rate for the loan was Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.05%.Under the terms of the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan, Piedmont OP is subject to certain financial covenants that require, among other things, the maintenance of an unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75, an unencumbered leverage ratio of at least 1.60, a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50, a leverage ratio of no more than 0.60, and a secured debt ratio of no more than 0.40.The foregoing does not purport to be a complete description of the terms of the $215 Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Loan Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.'\n"," 'None'\n"," 'Loan and Security AgreementOn the Effective Date, Flooring Affiliated, as the initial borrower and a guarantor, Flooring Liquidators, Elite, and 7D, as borrowers (and together with Flooring Affiliated, the “Borrowers”), and SJ & K and Floorable, as guarantors (and together with Flooring Affiliated, the “Guarantors”; and together with the Borrowers, the “Loan Parties”) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“Loan and Security Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and Eclipse Business Capital LLC, as agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders are providing a term loan in the amount of approximately $3.5 million (the “M&E Term Loan”) and, from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (as defined therein), at the Borrower’s request, will make revolving loans (“Revolving Loans”) and letters of credit (“Letters of Credit”) available to the Borrowers. The Loan and Security Agreement provides for a maximum amount available under the revolving loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) of $25.0 million (the “Maximum Revolving Facility Amount”), provided that the outstanding balance of all Revolving Loans will not exceed the lesser of the (i) Maximum Revolving Facility Amount and the (ii) Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement). The Agent may, from time to time, establish and revise reserves (“Reserves”) against the Borrowing Base and the Maximum Revolving Facility Amount in such amounts and of such types as Agent deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect certain specified matters.The Borrowers are obligated under the Loan and Security Agreement to make prepayments in certain specified situations. Additionally, in the event of any voluntary prepayment or certain mandatory prepayments of the M&E Term Loan or any permanent reduction in the Maximum Revolving Facility Amount, the Borrowers are required to pay a prepayment penalty of 3.0% if the prepayment is within the first year following the closing or 1.0% if the prepayment is within the second year following the closing.The M&E Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of:i)6.0% plus the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement), andii)5.0% plus the Base Rate (generally the greatest of 1.0%, federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.0%).Prior to April 1, 2023, all Loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of:i)4.5% plus the Adjusted Term SOFR, andii)3.5% plus the Base Rate.After April 1 2023, the applicable margin to Adjusted Term SOFR and the Base Rate on the Revolving Credit Facility will be adjusted on a quarterly basis based on agreed thresholds of the Borrowers’ Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Average Excess Availability (each as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) ranging from 3.75% to 4.50% for Loans based on Adjusted Term SOFR and 2.75% to 3.50% for Loans based on the Base Rate. Following certain specified events of default, all Loans may, at the option of Agent or the discretion of the Lenders, bear interest at a rate 2.0% higher than the otherwise applicable rate.The Borrowers agreed to pay customary closing and administrative fees in connection with the Loan and Security Agreement, as well as letter of credit fees and an unused line fee on the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.5% per annum of the amount on which the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility Amount exceeds the average daily outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans during the immediately preceding month.The Borrowers agreed to certain financial covenants in connection with the Loan and Security Agreement, including: (i) not permitting excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time to be less than $750,000, unless the Loan Parties’ Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) for the twelve consecutive calendar month period then ended is greater than 1.10 to 1.00 and (ii) agreeing not to make any capital expenditures if, after giving effect to such expenditures, the aggregate cost of all capital expenditures of the Loan Parties for the fiscal year would exceed $2.0 million.The proceeds of all Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are to be used by the Borrowers to finance a portion of the Acquisition, to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Loan and Security Agreement and the Acquisition, for Borrowers’ working capital and general corporate purposes and for such other purposes as specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement.The Loan and Security Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Borrowers, Lenders and Guarantors.The foregoing brief summary descriptions of certain terms and provisions of the Loan and Security Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Loan and Security Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.112 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.The Purchase Agreement, the Employment Agreements, the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, the Note, the ICG Note, the Spriggs Note and the Spriggs Loan, and the Loan and Security Agreement (as defined below) (collectively, the “Transaction Agreements”) and the descriptions above have been included to provide investors and securityholders with certain information regarding the terms of each agreement.

The proceeds of the issuance of the Series 2023-1A Securities were loaned to the Borrowers pursuant to the Loan Agreement (each as defined below). The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and an affiliate of the Company purchased, $68.5 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2023-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the “Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the Securities.The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse componentized loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “Borrowers”) pursuant to the Second Supplement and Amendment dated as of March 13, 2023 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 (collectively, the “Loan Agreement”), in each case, among the foregoing parties. The Borrowers are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the Borrowers’ interests in certain wireless communications and related tower sites (the “Sites”).The Securities issued by the Trust correspond to components of the Loan made to the Borrowers. As indicated in the table below, the Securities were issued in two separate Subclasses of the same Series. The Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities. The initial principal balances and the interest rates with respect to the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities are set forth below. The Securities have an expected life of approximately five years with a final repayment date in March 2053.SubclassInitial Class Principal BalanceInterest RateRating (Moody's/Fitch)Series 2023-1A$1,300,000,000.005.490%Aaa(sf)/AAA(sf)Series 2023-1R$68,500,000.005.735%N/AThe debt service on the Loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from the operation of the Sites held by the Borrowers.

Upon the occurrence and continuance of such a completed default, the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture, subject to any provisions of law applicable thereto, provides that the Trustee may take possession and conduct the business of SIGECO, may sell the Mortgaged and Pledged Property, or proceed to foreclose the lien of the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture. The interest rate on defaulted principal, premium, if any, and interest, to the extent permitted by law, on the FMBs is the rate stated in the applicable supplement.Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and its affiliates have performed other trust, bank and advisory services for the Company, SIGECO and their affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company and SIGECO and their affiliates in the ordinary course of their business.The above description of the Supplemental Indenture and the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indenture and the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture, a copy of each of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively.'\n"," 'On March 15, 2023, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (“SIGECO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the “Company”), and certain institutional investors in the private placement market (“Purchasers”) entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement (“Bond Purchase Agreement”), under which SIGECO agreed to sell, and each Purchaser agreed to severally purchase on March 15, 2023, $100,000,000 4.98% First Mortgage Bonds, Series 2023A, Tranche A due 2028 (the “Tranche A Bonds”) and $80,000,000 5.04% First Mortgage Bonds, Series 2023A, Tranche B due 2033 (the “Tranche B Bonds”, and together with the Tranche A Bonds, the “Bonds”) in the series and tranche as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement. The Bonds are issued under and entitled to the benefits of and secured by the Amended and Restated Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of January 1, 2023 (the “Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture”) between SIGECO and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the “Trustee”), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 15, 2023 (the “First Supplemental Indenture”), between SIGECO and the Trustee relating to the Bonds (the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture is referred to as the “Indenture”). Accordingly, the Bonds will be secured ratably with SIGECO’s first mortgage bonds currently outstanding and those that may be issued in the future by the collateral pledged to secure such bonds. The proceeds of the Bonds will be used for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt and refunding long-term debt at maturity or otherwise. Until the net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds have been used, SIGECO may invest them temporarily in interest-bearing obligations, including investments in the Company’s money pool.Interest will accrue on the Tranche A Bonds at 4.98% per annum and will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2023 and continue until the maturity date of March 15, 2028, or earlier prepayment. Interest will accrue on the Tranche B Bonds at 5.04% per annum and will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2023 and continue until the maturity date of March 15, 2033, or earlier prepayment. SIGECO may prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Bonds, in an amount not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds or tranche of Bonds then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the aggregate principal amount so prepaid together with interest accrued thereon to the date of such prepayment plus a make-whole amount, if any, determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount. The Bonds will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), or under the securities laws of any jurisdiction. The Bonds will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and may only be sold in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.The Bond Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of SIGECO and the Purchasers, respectively. A “completed default” under the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture constitutes an event of default under the Bond Purchase Agreement. The remedies available to the Trustee upon the occurrence and continuance of a completed default are included in the Indenture.Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and its affiliates have performed other trust, bank and advisory services for the Company, SIGECO and their affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company and SIGECO and their affiliates in the ordinary course of their businesses.The above descriptions of the Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Bond Purchase Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the entire Amended and Restated Mortgage Indenture, First Supplemental Indenture, together with the forms of the Bonds included therein, and the Bond Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 10.1 and incorporated by reference.'\n"," 'The information included in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form8-Kis incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'The disclosure under Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.'\n"," 'The information in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.'\n"," 'The information set forth in the Introductory Note and Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in this Item 2.03.Field: Page; Sequence: 4Field: /Page'\n"," 'The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'The information included in Item 1.01 of this report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.'\n"," 'To the extent required by Item 2.03 of Form 8-K, the information contained in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.'\n"," 'To the extent required by Item 2.03 of Form 8-K, the information contained in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.'\n"," 'The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.'\n"," 'On February 10, 2023, AMN Healthcare, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMN, entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) with respect to the existing Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement), dated as of February 9, 2018, by and among the Company, AMN, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, the several lenders party thereto from time to time (the “Lenders”) and Truist Bank, as administrative agent.

The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of April 29, 2010 (as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof, the “Base Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee, as supplemented by the Tenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2023 (the “Tenth Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), among the Company, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (the “Guarantor”) and the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of each Note. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement filed on September 22, 2020 onForm S-3, FileNo. 333-248963.The Notes bear interest at the applicable rates per annum listed in the description of the Notes above, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 9 and September 9 of each year, commencing on September 9, 2023. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional senior unsecured basis initially by the Guarantor, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.The Indenture provides, among other things, that prior to March 9, 2026 in the case of the 2026 Notes or February 9, 2028 in the case of the 2028 Notes (the “2028 Notes Par Call Date”), the Company may redeem the 2026 Notes or 2028 Notes, as applicable, at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming, in the case of the 2028 Notes, the 2028 Notes to be redeemed matured on the 2028 Notes Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a360-dayyear consisting of twelve30-daymonths) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2026 Notes or 30 basis points in the case of the 2028 Notes, less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption; and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after the 2028 Notes Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the 2028 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, in the event of a change of control triggering event with respect to a series of Notes, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes of such series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.The terms of the Indenture will, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to (i) create or incur debt secured by liens on certain property, or upon shares of capital stock or evidence of indebtedness issued by any of the Company’s subsidiaries, and owned by the Company or by any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and will limit the ability of the Company and the Guarantor to merge, sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of their property. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount outstanding of a series of Notes may declare the principal and the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such series of Notes to be due and payable. These events of default are subject to a number of important qualifications, limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.The foregoing description does not purport to be complete
